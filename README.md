# Biohacking
Biohacking refers to a broad range of practices that involve making changes to one’s biology in order to optimize performance, health, and well-being. It ranges from simple lifestyle changes, such as improving diet and sleep, to more advanced experiments with technology and biology. The idea behind biohacking is that we can ```"hack" our bodies and minds, much like a computer```, by making calculated adjustments to improve our overall capabilities and life quality.

> Some common forms of biohacking include:

* Nutrigenomics: Adjusting diet based on individual genetic makeup to optimize health and prevent disease.
* Grinder: Implanting or integrating technology (like sensors or chips) into the body to augment human abilities.
* DIY Biology: Experimenting with biotechnology or genetic modifications, often in personal labs, to enhance biological functions.
* Biohackers aim to push the boundaries of human performance—whether it's physical endurance, cognitive function, or longevity—using data-driven methods and cutting-edge science.
